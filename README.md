# slackbotTutorial

We're making a slackbot! Slack is a communications platform that we use extensively here at DALI Lab, and there are a lot of things thatcan be done with it.... like making bot users :)

In order to make your own bot, you'll need to: \n
1. clone this repo onto your mac/pc. \n
2. get into the directory via your favorite terminal. \n
3. npm install. \n
4. Go to the link on the slideshow and make a new bot. \n
5. Fill in your own description, name, etc. \n
6. create and copy the slackbot token. \n
4. add your slackbot token into the code. \n
5. type into terminal: npm run dev. \n
6. Have fun! Experiment with your slackbot. Talk to him. Invite him to Tronville. Copy and paste some code off the internet. The options are endless!. \n

# Inspiration
The code from this activity is a modification of the example code from HowdyAI's Botkit, a Slack-endorsed library for interacting with bot users and other integrations using Node.js.
The original files were forked from Tim Tregubov.
