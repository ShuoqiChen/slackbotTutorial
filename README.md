# slackbotTutorial

We're making a slackbot! Slack is a communications platform that we use extensively here at DALI Lab, and there are a lot of things thatcan be done with it.... like making bot users :)

In order to make your own bot, you'll need to:
1. clone this repo onto your mac/pc
2. get into the directory via your favorite terminal
3. npm install
4. Go to the link on the slideshow and make a new bot
5. Fill in your own description, name, etc
6. create and copy the slackbot token
4. add your slackbot token into the code
5. type into terminal: npm run dev
6. Have fun! Experiment with your slackbot. Talk to him. Invite him to Tronville. Copy and paste some code off the internet. The options are endless!

# Inspiration
The code from this activity is a modification of the example code from HodyAI's Botkit, a Slack-endorsed library for interacting with bot users and other integrations using Node.js.
The original files were forked from Tim Tregubov.
