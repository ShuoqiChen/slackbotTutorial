# slackbotTutorial

We're making a slackbot! [Slack](https://slack.com/) is a communications platform that we use extensively here at [DALI Lab](http://dali.dartmouth.edu/), and there are a lot of things that can be done with it.... like making [bot users](https://api.slack.com/bot-users) :)

In order to make your own bot, you'll need to:
* 1. clone this repo onto your mac/pc.
* 2. get into the directory via your favorite terminal.
* 3. npm install.
* 4. Go to the link on the slideshow and make a new bot. [](https://dali-lab.slack.com/apps/A0F7YS25R-bots)
* 5. Fill in your own description, name, etc.
* 6. create and copy the slackbot token.
* 7. add your slackbot token into the code.
* 8. type into terminal: npm run dev.
* 9. Have fun! Experiment with your slackbot. Talk to him. Invite him to Tronville. Copy and paste some code off the internet. The options are endless!.

# Inspiration
The code from this activity is a modification of the example code from [HowdyAI's Botkit](https://github.com/howdyai/botkit), a Slack-endorsed library for interacting with bot users and other integrations using Node.js.
The original files were forked from Tim Tregubov.
